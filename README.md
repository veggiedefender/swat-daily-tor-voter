#How do I use this?

`python2 torvote.py`

You need some stuff installed but I forget what, so be careful. You might have to adjust the host/port if your Tor configuration is non-standard.

Then just fill in the info it asks for. Use inspect element (ctrl + shift + i in Chrome) in your browser to get the comment ID.

#Why was this created?
For giggles and to see if I could. This is a proof of concept only (wink).
